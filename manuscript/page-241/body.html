                 Of marriageable men. This planet’s store
                 In iron, cotton, wool, or chemicals—
                 All matter rendered to our plastic skill,
                 Is wrought in shapes responsive to demand;
                 The market’s pulse makes index high or low,
                 By rule sublime. Our daughters must be wives,
                 And to the wives must be what men will choose;
                 Men’s taste is woman’s test. You mark the phrase?
                 ‘Tis good, I think?—the sense well-winged and poised

                 Give us the test of taste. A fine _menu_—
                 Is it to-day what Roman epicures
                 Insisted that a gentleman must eat
                 To earn the dignity of dining well?</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Brackenshaw Park, where the archery meeting was held, looked out from its gentle heights far over the</p></div> </div>
