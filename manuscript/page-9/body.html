<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>Let thy chief terror be of thine own soul:
There, ‘mid the throng of hurrying desires
That trample on the dead to seize their spoil,
Lurks vengeance, footless, irresistible
As exhalations laden with slow death,
And o’er the fairest troop of captured joys
Breathes pallid pestilence.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
