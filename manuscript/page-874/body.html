<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">love to Lydia
  Glasher, she passes on to you. You have broken your word to her, that
  you might possess what was hers. Perhaps you think of being happy, as
  she once was, and of having beautiful children such as hers, who will
  thrust hers aside. God is too just for that. The man you have married
  has a withered heart. His best young love was mine: you could not take
  that from me when you took the rest. It is dead: but I am the grave
  in which your chance of happiness is buried as well as mine. You had
  your warning. You have chosen to injure me and my children. He had
  meant to marry me. He would have married me at last, if you had not
  broken your word. You will have your punishment. I desire it with all
  my soul.
  Will you give him this letter to set him against me and ruin us
  moreâ€”me and my children? Shall you like to stand before your husband
  with these diamonds on you,</blockquote></div> </div>
