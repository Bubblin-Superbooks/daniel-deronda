  so as not to imply that you suspect any particular want of money on
  his part, but only that there is a strong wish on yours. What I have
  formerly said to him has been in the way of a conjecture that you
  might be willing to give a good sum for his chance of Diplow; but if
  Mr. Deronda came armed with a definite offer, that would take another
  sort of hold. Ten to one he will not close for some time to come; but
  the proposal will have got a stronger lodgment in his mind; and though
  at present he has a great notion of the hunting here, I see a
  likelihood, under the circumstances, that he will get a distaste for
  the neighborhood, and there will be the notion of the money sticking
  by him without being urged. I would bet on your ultimate success. As I
  am not to be exiled to Siberia, but am to be within call, it is
  possible that, by and by, I may be of more service to you.</blockquote></div> </div>
