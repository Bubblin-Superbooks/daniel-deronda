  to send you any more, and you must not borrow of the Langens, for I

  prepare you for it better—but a dreadful calamity has befallen us
  all. You know nothing about business and will not understand it; but
  Grapnell & Co. have failed for a million, and we are totally
  ruined—your aunt Gascoigne as well as I, only that your uncle has his
  benefice, so that by putting down their carriage and getting interest
  for the boys, the family can go on. All the property our poor father
  saved for us goes to pay the liabilities. There is nothing I can call
  my own. It is better you should know this at once, though it rends my
  heart to have to tell it you. Of course we cannot help thinking what a
  pity it was that you went away just when you did. But I shall never
  reproach you, my dear child; I would save you</blockquote></div> </div>
