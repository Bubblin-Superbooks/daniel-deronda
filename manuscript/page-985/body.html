<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter Xxxv.</h4><blockquote class="  "><p>  Were uneasiness of conscience measured by extent of crime, human
  history had been different, and one should look to see the contrivers
  of greedy wars and the mighty marauders of the money-market in one
  troop of self-lacerating penitents with the meaner robber and
  cut-purse and the murderer that doth his butchery in small with his own
  hand. No doubt wickedness hath its rewards to distribute; but who so
  wins in this devil’s game must needs be baser, more cruel, more brutal
  than the order of this planet will allow for the multitude born of
  woman, the most of these carrying a form of conscience—a fear which
  is the shadow of justice, a pity which is the shadow of love—that
  hindereth from the prize of serene wickedness, itself difficult of
  maintenance in our composite flesh.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
