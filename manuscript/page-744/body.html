I let him hang on me because he has always been a poor devil,” said Grandcourt, in an <em>adagio</em> of utter indifference. “They got him to travel with me when I was a lad. He was always that coarse-haired kind of brute—sort of cross between a hog and a <em>dilettante</em>.”</p><p>Gwendolen laughed.

Really, she thought, he was likely to be the least disagreeable of husbands.</p><p>Mrs. Davilow was waiting anxiously in her bed-room when Gwendolen entered, stepped toward her quickly, and kissing her on both cheeks said in a low tone, “Come down, mamma, and see Mr. Grandcourt. I am engaged to him.”</p></div> </div>
