The <em>maggior dolore</em> and the <em>miseria</em> have lasted longer than the <em>tempo felice</em>.” She paused and then went on dreamily,—“_Dolore—miseria_—I think those words are alive.”</p><p>Deronda was mute: to question her seemed an unwarrantable freedom; he shrank from appearing to claim the authority of a benefactor, or to treat her with the less reverence because she was in distress. She went on musingly,</p><p>“I thought it was not wicked. Death and life are one before the Eternal. I know our fathers slew their children and then slew themselves, to keep their souls pure. I meant it so. But now I am commanded to live. I cannot see how I shall live.”</p><p>“You will find friends. I will find them for you.”</p><p>She shook her head and said mournfully, “Not my mother and brother. I cannot find them.”</p></div> </div>
