But he was none the less quick in invention and decision.</p><p>“Mirah, <em>Liebchen</em>,” he said, in the old caressing way, “shouldn’t you like me to make myself a little more respectable before my son sees me?

With a good shirt and coat on my back, people would be glad enough to have me. I could offer myself for a courier, if I didn’t look like a broken-down mountebank. I should like to be with my children, and forget and forgive. But you have never seen your father look like this before. If you had ten pounds at hand—or I could appoint you to bring it me somewhere—I could fit myself out by the day after to-morrow.”</p></div> </div>
