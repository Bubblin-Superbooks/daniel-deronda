<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">of the best of women, who
  make others glad that they were born. I do not yet see how that can
  be, but you know better than I. If it ever comes true, it will be
  because you helped me. I only thought of myself, and I made you
  grieve. It hurts me now to think of your grief. You must not grieve
  any more for me. It is betterâ€”it shall be better with me because I
  have known you.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
