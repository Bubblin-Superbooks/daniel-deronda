<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter I.</h4><blockquote class="  "><p>  Men can do nothing without the make-believe of a beginning. Even
  science, the strict measurer, is obliged to start with a make-believe
  unit, and must fix on a point in the starsâ€™ unceasing journey when his
  sidereal clock shall pretend that time is at Nought. His less accurate
  grandmother Poetry has always been understood to start in the middle;
  but on reflection it appears that her proceeding is not very different
  from his; since Science, too, reckons backward as well as forward,
  divides his unit into billions, and with his clock-finger at Nought
  really sets off <em>in medias res</em>. No retrospect will take us to
  the true beginning; and whether our prologue be in heaven or on earth,
  it is but a fraction of that all-presupposing fact with which our
  story sets out.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
